# Todo CLI (Starter)

This is a minimal Node.js command-line app to get started.  
Right now it only echoes back what you type,  your job is to extend it into a full Todo CLI.

## Requirements
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- No external dependencies

## Run
```bash
node index.js
````

## Usage

* Type anything and press **Enter** → it will echo back.
* Type `exit` → program ends.

## Next Steps

* Add commands like `login`, `add`, `list`, `done`, `delete`.
* Store todos in memory (arrays/objects).
* Support multiple users.
* Enforce limits and validation.

## Workflow

* Do **not** commit directly to `main`.
* Create a new branch for your work (e.g., `<your-name>/todo-cli`).
* When you finish the task, open a **Pull Request (PR)** into `master`.
* The PR should include your code changes and a short description of what you implemented.
